  // warm by the time Kodi asks and those calls become instant, cache-only
  // reads. When a check here does find the cache stale and refreshes it,
  // this thread also calls TriggerChannelUpdate()/
  // TriggerChannelGroupsUpdate()/TriggerEpgUpdate() itself, the same way
  // the recording refresh thread above does for recordings/timers --
  // Kodi's own periodic EPG re-poll would eventually pick this up anyway,
  // but there's no reason to wait for that when this addon already knows
  // the moment new data landed. Started in the constructor, joined in the
