# Building pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial

Kodi binary addons aren't built standalone in the usual CMake sense --
they're built through Kodi's own addon build harness so the resulting
`.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib` links against exactly the right Kodi ABI. This repo's
`CMakeLists.txt` supplies the addon side of that (`find_package(Kodi
REQUIRED)` + `build_addon(...)`); the harness lives in Kodi's own source
tree at `tools/depends/target/binary-addons`.

This needs real network access (to clone Kodi, fetch nlohmann/json and
pugixml via CMake's `FetchContent`, and pull system libcurl) that this chat
sandbox doesn't have -- do the actual build with **Claude Code** or your own
machine/CI. The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml`
automates the Windows/macOS/Linux steps below on every push.

## Linux / macOS (x86_64)

1. Clone a Kodi source tree matching your target Kodi major version. This
   addon targets Kodi 22 "Piers" (PVR instance API 9.x). Piers has no
   release branch of its own yet -- it is still `master` -- so pin to the
   `22.0b2-Piers` tag rather than tracking `master`, which will move on to
   Kodi 23's API as soon as Piers is branched off:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch 22.0b2-Piers --depth 1 https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git kodi-source
   ```
   Switch this to `--branch Piers` once that branch exists. Building
   against the `Omega` branch instead gives you a Kodi 21 addon, which
   will not load in Kodi 22: Kodi 22 raised the PVR instance API from
   8.3.0 to 9.2.0 *and* its minimum to 9.2.0, so the two are mutually
   exclusive by design. The last release built against Omega is `0.11.0`.
2. Clone this addon next to it (any path):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BruiserBrody17/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial.git addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial
   ```
3. Register the addon with the harness. `pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial` isn't in Kodi's
   official addon manifests, so `ADDON_SRC_PREFIX` alone won't find it --
   the harness needs an explicit definition file pointing at the local
   checkout via a `file://` URL:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p addon-defs/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial
   echo "pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial file://$(pwd)/addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial" \
     > addon-defs/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial.txt
   ```
4. Run the addon build harness. `PREFIX` is required even for a native
   (non-cross-compiling) build -- point it at any writable install
   destination:
   ```bash
   cd kodi-source
   make -j$(nproc) -C tools/depends/target/binary-addons \
     ADDONS="pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial" \
     ADDONS_DEFINITION_DIR="$(pwd)/../addon-defs" \
     PREFIX="$(pwd)/../install" \
     EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DPACKAGE_ZIP=ON" \
     PACKAGE=1
   ```
   On macOS, this same `make` invocation works from a shell with Xcode
   command line tools installed; see the next section for Windows, which
   doesn't have `make` and needs a couple of extra dependency steps. If a
   prior run failed partway through, delete
   `tools/depends/target/binary-addons/.installed-native` first -- the
   harness touches that marker even after a failed configure, which
   otherwise makes it skip reconfiguring on the next run.

   **The same marker also needs clearing on an ordinary rebuild against
   updated source, not just after a failure** (confirmed live, 2026-09-09,
   rebuilding a persistent Linux build tree from an earlier session that
   was still at `0.9.0`): with `ADDONS_DEFINITION_DIR` pointing at a
   `file://` path (a live local checkout, not a version-pinned tarball
   URL the way CoreELEC's `package.mk` works), the harness has no signal
   that the addon's own source content changed at all -- same URL every
   time -- so it silently no-ops (`make: Nothing to be done for 'all'`)
   and leaves the old binary in place. Confirmed the fix needs *two*
   things removed, not just one: `.installed-native` itself, and the
   addon's own stale ExternalProject state,
   `tools/depends/target/binary-addons/native/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-prefix/`
   (its stamp files are what the *inner* CMake target checks, one layer
   below the outer marker) -- deleting only one of the two still no-op'd.
   A version bump alone doesn't fix this either, since the file:// URL
   itself never changes across versions the way a tagged tarball's would.
5. `-DPACKAGE_DIR` looks like it should redirect where CPack writes the
   zip, but doesn't actually take effect for this harness (confirmed:
   verified against a real run, CPack still wrote it deep inside the
   addon's own ExternalProject build tree regardless of that flag) --
   `PACKAGE_ZIP=ON` alone is what makes CPack build it at all, so find it
   afterward instead of trusting `PACKAGE_DIR`:
   ```bash
   find tools/depends/target/binary-addons -name 'addon-pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-*.zip'
   ```
   That zip (named e.g. `addon-pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-0.1.0-osx-arm64.zip`) is
   what you install via Kodi's
   "install from zip file" option, or publish in a self-hosted repository
   (see the "Distribution" section below).

**Confirmed live on a real Rocky Linux 10 install (0.4.0):** the steps
above work as documented -- gcc 14/cmake 3.31 from the distro's own repos
built it cleanly, no compatibility issues, once `libcurl-devel` was
installed (the one dependency not present by default). Kodi itself
wasn't packaged for RHEL10/Rocky10 yet at the time (too new for RPM
Fusion); the official Kodi Flatpak (`flatpak install flathub
tv.kodi.Kodi`) worked as a real, officially-supported alternative --
confirmed the natively-built `.so` above loads and runs correctly inside
that Flatpak's sandboxed runtime with no ABI issues.

**A real, non-obvious gotcha if launching Kodi non-interactively (e.g.
over SSH) rather than from the desktop's own app launcher: Kodi's own
process crashed on startup** (`std::vector<...>::front() [CpuData]:
Assertion '!this->empty()' failed`, inside Kodi's own CPU-monitoring
code, before this addon was even instantiated) **when launched without
the logged-in session's actual display environment.** `ssh user@host
'flatpak run tv.kodi.Kodi'` doesn't inherit `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`DISPLAY`/
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` from the real graphical session at all --
confirmed fixed by pulling those from an already-running process that
*is* part of that session (e.g. `tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/<gnome-shell
pid>/environ`) and exporting them (along with `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`) before
the `flatpak run` call. Once launched with the correct display
environment, Kodi ran completely stably -- this was an environmental
launch-context issue, not a bug in Kodi or this addon.

## Windows (x86_64)

Windows has no `make` and no system libcurl, so this doesn't go through
`tools/depends/target/binary-addons` -- instead it invokes the same
underlying `cmake/addons` project that Makefile wraps, directly, with the
Visual Studio generator. `.github/workflows/build.yml` automates all of
this; the steps below are what that workflow actually runs; every step here
was verified against a real build, not just written from Kodi's docs.

The `-G "Visual Studio ..."` generator string below must match whichever
Visual Studio version is actually installed -- CMake doesn't fall back to
whatever's present, it fails outright ("could not find any instance of
Visual Studio") if you name a version that isn't there. This has already
bitten CI once: GitHub's `windows-latest` runner moved to shipping only VS
2026 (`"Visual Studio 18 2026"`) with no VS2022 left on the image at all,
confirmed by running `vswhere -all -format json` in the workflow. A local
machine may well still have VS2022 (`"Visual Studio 17 2022"`) instead --
check what you actually have (Visual Studio Installer, or `vswhere -all`)
rather than assuming either one.

**Enable git's long-path support before cloning anything, or a deeply
nested dependency clone can fail outright.** `git config --global
core.longpaths true` (or `--system`, for CI). Confirmed live: CI's
`build-windows` job failed with a real `Filename too long` error cloning
`nlohmann-json` (a `FetchContent` dependency) -- some of that repo's own
historical test-report filenames are long enough that the *addon's own
build-directory path* nested above them (which embeds this addon's id)
pushed the combined path past Windows' 260-char `MAX_PATH`, and it got
12 characters worse twice over from the `pvr.dispatcharr` ->
`pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial` rename: once in the addon id itself
(appearing multiple times in the nested `<id>-prefix`/`<id>-build`
directory names CMake's `ExternalProject` generates), and again in the
GitHub repo name forming the root of CI's own checkout path
(`D:\a\<repo>\<repo>\...`). The exact same commit's CI run had passed
minutes earlier, before the repo got renamed -- the shorter
pre-rename checkout path was still just under the limit. A local build
can hit this too depending on how deep the workspace path already is;
this project's own `kodi-win-work` example workspace was only 7
characters under the limit for this exact file even before accounting
for the rename, so treat this as something to fix once globally on any
Windows build machine, not just a CI-specific patch.

1. Clone Kodi and this addon exactly as in steps 1-2 above (the
   `22.0b2-Piers` tag, this repo checked out under
   `addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial`), and register the addon exactly as
   in step 3.
2. Fetch curl and its own dependencies. Windows has no system libcurl, and
   the prebuilt curl Kodi's own dependency mirror serves needs OpenSSL and
   zlib to link against (confirmed by actually running this build -- curl's
   own `CURLConfig.cmake` pulls both in transitively). Point
   `ADDON_DEPENDS_PATH` at the *same* depends directory the main addon build
   will look in by default (`<BUILD_DIR>/depends`), so one `find_package`
   picks up both Kodi's own generated config and these:
   ```powershell
   $depends = "$pwd\build\build\depends"
   $prebuilt = "kodi-source\cmake\addons\depends\windows\prebuilt"
   "curl http://mirrors.kodi.tv/build-deps/win32/curl-7.67.0-x64-v141-20200105.7z" `
     | Out-File -Encoding ascii "$prebuilt\curl.txt"
   "openssl http://mirrors.kodi.tv/build-deps/win32/openssl-1.1.1q-x64-v142-20221017.7z" `
     | Out-File -Encoding ascii "$prebuilt\openssl.txt"
   "zlib http://mirrors.kodi.tv/build-deps/win32/zlib-1.2.11-x64-v141-20200105.7z" `
     | Out-File -Encoding ascii "$prebuilt\zlib.txt"
   cmake -S kodi-source\cmake\addons\depends\windows -B deps-build -G "Visual Studio 18 2026" -A x64 "-DADDON_DEPENDS_PATH=$depends"
   cmake --build deps-build --config Release
   ```
   Then delete the three `.txt` files you just created. The main build's own
   generic dependency scan (`add_addon_depends`) also globs this same
   `prebuilt/` directory, and having both declare a same-named CMake target
   is a hard configure error -- the files have done their job once the real
   `.lib`/`.dll` files are sitting in `$depends`.
3. Configure and build the addon itself. Quote every `-D` argument as one
   token (`"-DFOO=bar"`, not `-DFOO=bar` split across a line continuation) --
   PowerShell's backtick line continuation can otherwise truncate a value at
   the first `.` it contains, which silently turns `pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial` into
   just `pvr`:
   ```powershell
   cmake -S kodi-source\cmake\addons -B build -G "Visual Studio 18 2026" -A x64 `
     "-DADDONS_TO_BUILD=pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial" `
     "-DADDONS_DEFINITION_DIR=$pwd\addon-defs" `
     "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$pwd\install" `
     "-DPACKAGE_ZIP=ON" `
     "-DPACKAGE_DIR=$pwd\dist" `
     "-DBUILD_DIR=$pwd\build\build"
   cmake --build build --config Release --target package-pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial
   ```
   Don't pass a custom `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` here even if you're tempted to
   point it at a separate curl install location: `cmake/addons/CMakeLists.txt`
   builds that variable's final value via an *unquoted* `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`
   expansion, which silently drops every entry but the first when it's a
   multi-item list. Installing curl straight into the default depends path
   in step 2, and leaving `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` alone here, sidesteps that bug
   entirely.
4. `-DPACKAGE_DIR` doesn't actually redirect CPack's output here either (same
   as the Linux/macOS harness above) -- confirmed via a real run's CPack log,
   it instead drops the zip in the OS temp dir (`$env:TEMP`, e.g.
   `addon-pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-0.1.0-windows-x86_64.zip` under
   `C:\Users\<runner>\AppData\Local\Temp`). Find it there rather than in
   `dist`:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Path $env:TEMP -Filter 'addon-pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-*.zip' -Recurse
   ```
   That zip bundles `libcurl.dll` and `zlib.dll` alongside
   `pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial.dll` (see `CMakeLists.txt`'s `DISPATCHARR_ADDITIONAL_BINARY`),
   since a standalone Windows install can't assume those are already present
   the way Kodi's own bundled curl, or Linux's system libcurl, would be.

## CoreELEC on an ODROID N2+ (Amlogic S922X)

This is the part that most often causes "it built but Kodi won't load it"
problems, because CoreELEC ships its own cross-compiled Kodi build with a
specific compiler/libc/Kodi-commit combination -- a binary built against a
generic Linux aarch64 toolchain will very likely **not** be ABI-compatible,
even though it's technically the same architecture.

A GitHub Actions job for this was considered and rejected: CoreELEC's own
build harness (a LibreELEC fork) is designed around persistent, self-hosted
build infrastructure -- confirmed by reading LibreELEC's own addon-build
automation (`LibreELEC/actions` on GitHub), which runs on
`[self-hosted, nightly]` runners with a 12-hour timeout and host-mounted
`/sources`, `/target`, `/build-root` directories that persist across runs,
specifically so the cross toolchain and every dependency aren't rebuilt
from scratch every time. GitHub's hosted runners are ephemeral, capped at
6 hours, and give ~14GB free disk -- a real mismatch for a from-scratch
build, not just a "might be slow" one. Building locally is the practical
path.

### Building it as a CoreELEC package (recommended)

CoreELEC is a LibreELEC-derived buildroot distro; third-party binary Kodi
addons are added as a package under
`packages/mediacenter/kodi-binary-addons/<addon-name>/package.mk` in a
CoreELEC source checkout, following the same pattern as addons they
already ship. Unlike Kodi's own `tools/depends/target/binary-addons`
harness (used above), this doesn't support pointing at a live git branch --
every in-tree example (confirmed by reading CoreELEC/CoreELEC's real
`pvr.hts` and `pvr.iptvsimple` package.mk files) points `PKG_URL` at a
tagged release tarball with a pinned `PKG_SHA256`. A package definition for
this addon following that same pattern is checked in at
[`packaging/coreelec/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/package.mk`](../packaging/coreelec/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/package.mk).

**This whole path -- package.mk, checksum, branch, device, arch -- has now
been confirmed by an actual successful cross-compile** (`0.3.0`, against a
real WSL2/Ubuntu build machine): `ALL ADDONS BUILT SUCCESSFULLY`, producing
a genuine `pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-0.3.0.1.zip` whose `.so` is a real stripped
ELF binary, and every specific claim below (branch, device, arch, output
path) reflects what that run actually did, not documentation guesswork.
Several real problems surfaced and were fixed along the way -- they're
called out inline so a future rebuild doesn't have to rediscover them.

1. Tag and publish a GitHub release matching the version in
   `pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/addon.xml.in` (e.g. `0.4.0`, no `v` prefix -- CoreELEC's
   own package.mk files use the tag name verbatim in the archive URL, and
   keeping it identical to `PKG_VERSION` avoids a mismatch):
   ```bash
   git tag 0.4.0
   git push origin 0.4.0
   gh release create 0.4.0 --generate-notes
   ```
   **The GitHub repo must be public.** CoreELEC's build harness fetches
   `PKG_URL` with a plain anonymous `curl`/`wget` -- no auth, no token --
   so a private repo's archive URL 404s (GitHub's standard "hide
   existence" response to an unauthenticated request against a private
   repo). Confirmed live: this addon's own repo was still private from an
   earlier session, the cross-compile's very last step
   (`pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial:target`, after the entire toolchain had already
   built successfully) failed on exactly this 404, and switching the repo
   to public (`gh repo edit <repo> --visibility public
   --accept-visibility-change-consequences`) immediately fixed it -- no
   package.mk or build-harness change needed.
2. Compute the tarball's checksum and fill it into
   `packaging/coreelec/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/package.mk`'s `PKG_SHA256`:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/BruiserBrody17/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/archive/0.3.0.tar.gz | sha256sum
   ```
   Do this *after* the repo is public, against the real tarball -- doing
   it while the repo is still private silently hashes GitHub's 404 error
   page instead (confirmed live: this is exactly what happened building
   `0.3.0`, and the build failed with an explicit
   `Incorrect checksum calculated on downloaded file` once the repo was
   made public and the real tarball could finally be fetched, until the
   checksum was recomputed against the real content).
3. On a Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux build machine (not the N2+ itself --
   cross-compiling needs real CPU and disk; per CoreELEC's own build docs,
   budget 50GB free disk and expect the first build to take a while, since
   it also has to fetch/build the whole cross toolchain including GCC from
   source), clone CoreELEC at the branch matching your device's installed
   CoreELEC major version -- **use the branch matching the CoreELEC
   release actually installed on the device**: `coreelec-22` tracks Kodi
   22 "Piers", which is what this addon now targets, and `coreelec-21`
   tracks Kodi 21 "Omega", which it no longer does.

   History worth keeping, because it is what this release exists to fix:
   `coreelec-22` previously failed to cross-compile this addon outright,
   with `override` mismatches on `GetChannelStreamProperties`/
   `OpenRecordedStream`/`CloseRecordedStream`/`ReadRecordedStream`/
   `SeekRecordedStream`/`LengthRecordedStream`. All six were real,
   deliberate signature changes in the Kodi 22 PVR API (the
   recorded-stream methods gained a `streamId` parameter for
   concurrent-stream support; `GetChannelStreamProperties` gained a
   `PVR_SOURCE`), not bugs in this addon -- and as of `0.12.0` the addon
   implements the Kodi 22 signatures, so that build now succeeds. The
   trade is one-way: a `coreelec-21` build of `0.12.0` will now fail the
   same way in reverse, because those signatures no longer match Kodi 21's
   API. On a device still running CoreELEC 21 (`21.3-Omega` was its last
   Omega stable), build the `0.11.0` tag against `coreelec-21` instead.

   For a Kodi 22 device:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch coreelec-22 --depth 1 https://github.com/CoreELEC/CoreELEC.git
   mkdir -p CoreELEC/packages/mediacenter/kodi-binary-addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial
   cp packaging/coreelec/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/package.mk \
     CoreELEC/packages/mediacenter/kodi-binary-addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/
   ```
   **If this file was edited on Windows and copied into a WSL/Linux
   checkout, strip CRLF line endings before building** (confirmed live,
   2026-09-07): git's `core.autocrlf` normalizes this file to CRLF in a
   Windows working tree, and a plain `cp` into WSL carries that over
   byte-for-byte. The build harness's `PKG_IS_ADDON` comparison
   (`create_addon`'s `verify_addon`/`get_addons`) then compares against
   the literal string `"yes\r"`, not `"yes"` -- it fails silently (no
   error, `&>/dev/null`-suppressed), and the addon is simply missing from
   every listing (`create_addon pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial` and even `create_addon
   --show-only binary` both just omit it, with no indication why).
   Confirmed via `bash -x` tracing into `verify_addon`, which showed
   exactly this comparison failing. Fix:
   ```bash
   sed -i 's/\r$//' CoreELEC/packages/mediacenter/kodi-binary-addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/package.mk
   ```
4. Build it. Both the device name *and* the arch value have changed across
   CoreELEC branches -- don't assume either is stable across branches, and
   don't assume the SoC being 64-bit means the build's `ARCH` is
   `aarch64`:
   - **Device**: confirm by reading the target branch's own source tree
     for which device directory under `projects/Amlogic-ce/devices/` ships
     `Odroid_N2_boot.ini`. On `coreelec-22` it's a single combined
     `Amlogic-no` device; on `coreelec-21` it was `Amlogic-ng`, which
     doesn't exist on `coreelec-22` (both confirmed live, by reading each
     branch's own device tree). The `DEVICE=` value in the build command
     below is written for `coreelec-21` because that is the combination
     this section was originally verified end to end against -- on
     `coreelec-22` substitute `DEVICE=Amlogic-no`, and re-confirm `ARCH`
     the same way the next bullet describes rather than assuming the
     32-bit answer below still holds.
   - **Arch**: CoreELEC's own official `21.3-Omega` release for this
     device is literally named
     `CoreELEC-Amlogic-ng.arm-21.3-Omega-Odroid_N2.img.gz` (confirmed
     against CoreELEC's own GitHub releases) -- `arm`, not `aarch64`,
     despite the S922X being a 64-bit SoC: CoreELEC's `Amlogic-ng` device
     on the Omega branch runs a 32-bit (`armhf`/EABI5) userland on a
     64-bit kernel, not a true AArch64 userland. Passing `ARCH=aarch64`
     doesn't fail outright -- the build harness silently resolves the
     actual target to `arm` regardless (confirmed by the resulting build
     directory being named `...arm-21`, not `...aarch64-21`, and by the
     finished `.so` being `ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5`, not
     64-bit) -- but passing `ARCH=arm` explicitly matches reality and
     avoids the confusion:
   ```bash
   cd CoreELEC
   PROJECT=Amlogic-ce ARCH=arm DEVICE=Amlogic-ng ./scripts/create_addon pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial
   ```
   Two more real, confirmed-live failure modes to expect and how they were
   fixed, in case a future build hits them again (both are about *fetching
   dependency source tarballs*, not about this addon's own code):
   - **GNU mirror unreachability**: `ftpmirror.gnu.org` (and CoreELEC's
     own mirrors, `sources.coreelec.org` / `sources.libreelec.tv`) were
     unreachable from the network this was built on, failing `make`,
     `m4`, `autoconf`, `autoconf-archive`, `automake`, `bison`,
     `libtool`, `mpc`, `mpfr`, `readline`, `gcc`, and `gmp` in turn (each
     one only discovered by retrying after the previous one was fixed).
     `ftp.gnu.org` (the canonical, non-redirector GNU host) worked
     throughout. If this happens again: fetch the exact `PKG_VERSION`
     tarball from `https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/<pkg>/...` (or, for `gmp`,
     `https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/...`, since `gmp` doesn't use the
     `ftpmirror.gnu.org` host in its own `package.mk` but is served by
     the same broken `sources.coreelec.org`/`sources.libreelec.tv`
     mirrors as a fallback), verify it against that package's own
     `PKG_SHA256` in `packages/.../<pkg>/package.mk`, then drop it into
     `sources/<pkg>/<pkg>-<version>.<ext>` in the CoreELEC checkout
     alongside two matching sidecar files, `<same filename>.sha256`
     (just the hex digest) and `<same filename>.url` (the original
     `PKG_URL`) -- the build script skips fetching anything it finds
     already staged there with a matching checksum.
   - **`repo.or.cz` bot wall**: `rtmpdump`'s pinned git-snapshot URL
     (`repo.or.cz/rtmpdump.git/snapshot/<commit>.tar.gz`) returned an
     Anubis bot-check HTML page instead of the real tarball, from a plain
     `curl`/`wget` with no way to pass the JS challenge nor via a
     browser-like `User-Agent` header. The Wayback Machine had a genuine
     cached copy from before the bot wall existed (fetched via
     `https://web.archive.org/web/2023/<original URL>` -- note this
     worked even though `https://archive.org/wayback/available?url=...`
     reported no snapshot for the same URL) that matched `rtmpdump`'s own
     pinned `PKG_SHA256` exactly; staged the same way as the GNU packages
     above.
   One more confirmed-live finding on this path, not a failure -- the
   build succeeds, but the resulting `addon.xml`'s `<platform>` tag comes
   out empty (`<platform></platform>`), unlike the Linux/macOS/Windows
   steps above which correctly produce `<platform>linux</platform>` etc.
   Traced to Kodi's own upstream CMake build, not anything in this
   addon's own `addon.xml.in`/`CMakeLists.txt`/`package.mk`:
   `cmake/KodiConfig.cmake.in`'s `PLATFORM_TAG` substitution is only ever
   computed by `cmake/scripts/common/PrepareEnv.cmake`, which only
   `cmake/addons/CMakeLists.txt` (Kodi's own `tools/depends/target/
   binary-addons` addon-build harness used by the Linux/macOS/Windows
   steps above) `include()`s -- Kodi's own top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
   (which builds `kodi.bin` itself and installs `KodiConfig.cmake` for
   external SDK use, the file CoreELEC's `kodi-binary-addons` packaging
   class builds addons against directly) never does, so `PLATFORM_TAG` is
   simply undefined at that point and substitutes empty. Confirmed this
   isn't cross-compile-specific: even CoreELEC's own host-native x86_64
   build of Kodi (bootstrapping its own build tools) produces the same
   blank `PLATFORM_TAG` in its installed `KodiConfig.cmake`, and
   `PrepareEnv.cmake`/`AddonHelpers.cmake` themselves are byte-identical
   to a fresh upstream checkout -- this is a structural property of how
   Kodi's own build generates its external addon-SDK config on this path,
   affecting any addon CoreELEC packages this way, not something specific
   to this repo's own config. Likely harmless in practice -- Kodi's addon
   loader keys off the `library_linux` attribute (correctly populated) to
   find the actual binary, not the `<platform>` metadata tag -- but that's
   inference from reading Kodi's own install/load logic, not yet
   confirmed against a real device.
   Per CoreELEC's own wiki, the result lands under `target/addons/`; this
   is now confirmed against a real run -- exact path is
   `target/addons/<DEVICE>/<KODI_MAJOR_VERSION>/<ARCH>/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/`,
   e.g. `target/addons/Amlogic-ng/21.3/arm/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-0.3.0.1.zip`
   for this build (the `.1` is CoreELEC's own `PKG_REV`, not part of this
   addon's own version).
5. Install the resulting zip on the N2+ via Kodi's "install from zip file"
   option, or copy it over SSH and extract into
   `/storage/.kodi/addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/` directly, then restart Kodi.
6. This build isn't automated in CI (see the "GitHub Actions job ...
   rejected" note above) -- if this is a real tagged release, also attach
   the zip to the GitHub Release by hand so CoreELEC users have something
   to download instead of having to build it themselves:
   ```bash
   gh release upload <tag> target/addons/<DEVICE>/<KODI_MAJOR_VERSION>/<ARCH>/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-<version>.zip
   ```

For later releases, only steps 1-2 and the `cp`/build in steps 3-4 need
repeating -- the CoreELEC checkout itself can be reused, and with the
toolchain and every dependency already built and cached, a rebuild that
only touches this addon's own package is fast (~1 minute wall clock,
confirmed live, versus well over an hour for the first build from
scratch).

### Manual cross-compile + side-load (fallback)

If you'd rather not maintain a package.mk (e.g. testing an unreleased
commit), cross-compile using the same toolchain CoreELEC's build system
uses for the N2+ (`Amlogic-ce`/`Amlogic-ng`, `arm` -- see the confirmed
details above; not `Amlogic-no`/`aarch64`, which was true of an older,
no-longer-recommended branch), matching their exact GCC version and the
Kodi commit their release is built from, then copy the
resulting `.so` and a rendered `addon.xml` into
`/storage/.kodi/addons/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/` over SSH and restart Kodi. This
is more fragile than the package.mk route above (nothing pins the toolchain
version for you), so prefer that unless you specifically need to test a
build that isn't tagged.

Either way, pin the Kodi source tree/version you build against to the same
major version CoreELEC's current release ships, or the addon will fail to
load with an API-version mismatch even if the library itself loads fine.

## Android (arm/arm64)

Confirmed live end to end (2026-09-15/16) against two real physical
devices on real Android builds, not an emulator: a 32-bit ARM device on
Android 11 (LineageOS 18.1) and a 64-bit ARM device on Android 16
(LineageOS 23.2), both against a real Dispatcharr backend -- real channel
list (9,151 channels), real live playback, real live-timeshift seek, on
both architectures.

Unlike every other platform this addon has been built for, this addon's
own source (`src/*.cpp`) needed **zero** Android-specific changes --
only `CMakeLists.txt` needed one small addition (below). Kodi's own
upstream Android build tooling (`tools/depends`, the same "unified
depends" cross-compile system used under the hood for every non-native
target, including CoreELEC's own) has a real gap for binary addons that
CoreELEC's separate `package.mk`-based dependency wiring papers over,
and that this project's own Linux/macOS/Windows builds never hit either
(they all link a *shared* system/bundled libcurl) -- see "Android's
missing addon-dependency wiring" below before assuming a fresh Android
build will "just work" the way the other platforms do.

### 1. SDK/NDK toolchain

Kodi's own [`docs/README.Android.md`](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/docs/README.Android.md)
in the Kodi source tree is the authoritative reference; summarized here
for this addon's own needs. Requires Android SDK cmdline-tools plus NDK
r21e specifically (Kodi's own recommended/most-tested revision for the
`Omega` branch this project already builds against everywhere else):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-build/sdk
curl -sL -o cmdline-tools.zip \
  "https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-11076708_latest.zip"
mkdir -p sdk/cmdline-tools
unzip -q cmdline-tools.zip -d sdk/cmdline-tools
mv sdk/cmdline-tools/cmdline-tools sdk/cmdline-tools/latest

cd sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
yes | ./sdkmanager --sdk_root="$HOME/android-build/sdk" --licenses
./sdkmanager --sdk_root="$HOME/android-build/sdk" \
  platform-tools "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;33.0.1" "ndk;21.4.7075529"
```

Needs a JDK (confirmed live with OpenJDK 21) for `sdkmanager` itself --
unrelated to the addon's own C++ toolchain, which the NDK provides.

### 2. Configure and build Kodi's own dependency stack, per ABI

Each target ABI (`arm-linux-androideabi` for 32-bit ARM,
`aarch64-linux-android` for 64-bit ARM) needs its **own** configured
`tools/depends` tree -- confirmed live that running `./configure` twice
against the *same* Kodi source checkout for two different `--host`
triplets clobbers the first one's generated `Makefile.include` (there's
no per-target isolation the way `cmakebuildsys`'s own `BUILD_DIR` option
gives the full Kodi build). Use two separate checkouts (a cheap
`git worktree add --detach <path> <same-commit>` each, not a full second
clone) rather than reconfiguring one in place:

```bash
git worktree add --detach ~/android-build/kodi-source-arm64 <kodi-omega-commit>
git worktree add --detach ~/android-build/kodi-source-arm <kodi-omega-commit>

cd ~/android-build/kodi-source-arm64/tools/depends
./bootstrap
./configure --with-tarballs="$HOME/android-build/tarballs" \
  --host=aarch64-linux-android \
  --with-sdk-path="$HOME/android-build/sdk" \
  --with-ndk-path="$HOME/android-build/sdk/ndk/21.4.7075529" \
  --prefix="$HOME/android-build/xbmc-depends-arm64"
make -j$(nproc) -C tools/depends
```

Repeat for `~/android-build/kodi-source-arm` with
`--host=arm-linux-androideabi` and a separate `xbmc-depends-arm` prefix.
This builds curl, ffmpeg, and everything else Kodi itself needs, from
source, for that ABI -- expect a long first build (same shape as
CoreELEC's own from-scratch toolchain build). **`samba-gplv3` failing
with "Embedded Heimdal build requires flex but it was not found" is a
real, but harmless, failure for this addon specifically** -- it's
Kodi's own SMB/CIFS network-browsing support, entirely unrelated to a
Dispatcharr HTTP-only PVR client; confirmed the base dependency stack
(the part `tools/depends/target/binary-addons` actually needs) had
already logged `Dependencies built successfully.` before `make`
went on to attempt -- and fail on -- this unrelated optional package.
Install `flex` first if you'd rather avoid the failure entirely.

### 3. Android's missing addon-dependency wiring

`tools/depends/xbmc-addons.include` has dedicated `linux-system-libs`/
`linux-system-x11-libs`/etc. targets that symlink the host's own system
libraries into the addon build's own isolated dependency directory
(`tools/depends/target/binary-addons/<host-triplet>/build/depends/`,
confirmed by reading that file) -- but **no Android equivalent exists**.
Building this addon's own binary directly via
`tools/depends/target/binary-addons` (below) therefore fails
`find_package(CURL REQUIRED)` outright ("Could NOT find CURL") even
though curl was just built successfully in step 2 above, because
`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY`/`_INCLUDE` are set to `ONLY`
(confirmed by reading the generated `Toolchain_binaddons.cmake`) and
`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` never points at the real `xbmc-depends-arm64`/
`xbmc-depends-arm` prefix at all. Fixed by manually symlinking curl
(and, since Android's depends-built curl is static-only, its own
transitive link dependencies too) into that same isolated directory,
per ABI, before building:

```bash
DEPS_DIR=~/android-build/kodi-source-arm64/tools/depends/target/binary-addons/aarch64-linux-android-21-debug/build/depends
REAL_DEPENDS=~/android-build/xbmc-depends-arm64/aarch64-linux-android-21-debug
mkdir -p "$DEPS_DIR/include" "$DEPS_DIR/lib/pkgconfig"
ln -sf "$REAL_DEPENDS/include/curl" "$DEPS_DIR/include/curl"
for lib in libcurl.a libnghttp2.a libssl.a libcrypto.a libz.a; do
  ln -sf "$REAL_DEPENDS/lib/$lib" "$DEPS_DIR/lib/$lib"
done
```

(Repeat for the `arm`/`arm-linux-androideabi-21-debug` tree.) This still
isn't enough on its own -- `CMakeLists.txt` also needs to explicitly
list curl's own transitive static deps (OpenSSL, nghttp2, zlib) via
`find_library()`, since a bare library name in `target_link_libraries()`
becomes a plain `-lssl` passed straight to the linker (which only
searches its own default paths, not `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`) -- confirmed
live this fails ("cannot find -lssl") even with the `.a` symlinked in
place above, since unlike zlib, Android's NDK doesn't bundle OpenSSL at
all. This addon's own `CMakeLists.txt` already has this handled (see its
`if(ANDROID)` block); a fresh third-party addon hitting the same "Could
NOT find CURL" error should start here rather than assuming its own
`CMakeLists.txt` is at fault.

### 4. Build the addon

Once steps 2-3 are done for both ABIs:

```bash
cd ~/android-build/kodi-source-arm64
make -j$(nproc) -C tools/depends/target/binary-addons \
  ADDONS="pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial" \
  ADDONS_DEFINITION_DIR="$HOME/android-build/addon-defs" \
  PREFIX="$HOME/android-build/install-arm64" \
  EXTRA_CMAKE_ARGS="-DPACKAGE_ZIP=ON" \
  PACKAGE=1
```

(`ADDONS_DEFINITION_DIR` points at a plain
`pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial.txt` containing
`pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial file:///path/to/this/repo`, same convention
as every other platform.) Repeat against the `kodi-source-arm` tree with
its own `PREFIX`. Produces
`addon-pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-<version>-android-aarch64.zip`/
`-android-armv7.zip` under that build tree's own
`pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-prefix/src/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial-build/`.

### 5. Install Kodi and side-load the addon on a real device

Kodi for Android isn't preinstalled by any stock/LineageOS image --
install the official APK matching the addon zip's own ABI from
[Kodi's mirror](https://mirrors.kodi.tv/releases/android/), e.g.
`arm64-v8a/kodi-21.3-Omega-arm64-v8a.apk` (confirmed real package id
`org.xbmc.kodi`, min SDK 21, target SDK 34 via `aapt dump badging` --
comfortably compatible with both Android 11 and Android 16 devices
tested). Over `adb`:

```bash
adb install -r kodi-21.3-Omega-arm64-v8a.apk
adb shell am start -n org.xbmc.kodi/.Splash
```

First launch needs the "All files access" permission granted (Settings
-> Apps -> Kodi -> All files access) before it stops blocking on its own
"Kodi requires access to your device media and files" prompt -- confirmed
this is genuinely required, not optional, on both Android 11 and
Android 16. Kodi's real home directory on Android is
`/sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/` (confirmed live,
standard `addons`/`userdata`/etc. layout, same as every other platform)
-- side-load by extracting the built zip's own
`pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/` directory straight into `.kodi/addons/`
over `adb push` (Kodi stopped first), then
`Addons.SetAddonEnabled` over JSON-RPC once restarted, exactly like this
project's other manual-drop platforms (Linux/Windows/CoreELEC).

**Enabling `services.webserver` via a direct `guisettings.xml` edit
(this project's usual provisioning trick on every other platform) isn't
enough on Android by itself -- confirmed live.** Kodi shows a one-time
"Web server" info dialog and silently re-disables the setting if a
username/password isn't *also* configured: "You have previously enabled
the web interface without setting up a password. The web server has
been disabled until you either explicitly allow this or set up
authentication." Set `services.webserverusername`/
`services.webserverpassword` in the same edit as `services.webserver`
to avoid this -- confirmed fixed once both were set together.

Once JSON-RPC is reachable, `tools/kodi_smoke_test.py` works completely
unmodified -- same as every other platform, since it only ever speaks
Kodi's own platform-generic JSON-RPC API.

### A large real channel count can outrun Kodi's own first-boot EPG sync on old/slow hardware

Confirmed live (2026-09-15/16) on a 2014-era 32-bit ARM device (Snapdragon
801) against a real account with 9,151 channels: on a fresh install,
`PVR.GetBroadcasts` returned real, correctly-titled programme data for
every channel, but roughly 11% of channels (about 1,020 of 9,151) were
consistently missing their own `broadcastid` field -- while a 2021
64-bit ARM device, given far more elapsed idle time beforehand, showed
every channel correctly. This is **not an addon bug**: confirmed by
adding temporary diagnostic logging directly to `GetEPGForChannel()`
(logging both the computed id via `ComputeBroadcastId()` and an
immediate `tag.GetUniqueBroadcastId()` readback right before
`results.Add()`) that this addon's own id computation is correct --
plain, architecture-independent `uint32_t` arithmetic, verified to
produce real non-zero values -- for every channel Kodi actually asked
about. The affected channels were never asked about at all: this
addon's own `StartChannelEpgRefreshThread()` (see `src/PVRDispatcharr.cpp`)
calls Kodi's `TriggerEpgUpdate()` once per channel, for all channels
unconditionally, on a loop meant to repeat every `kChannelEpgRefreshCheckMinutes`
(10) -- but on this device, its own "background thread refreshed
channels/groups" log line appeared exactly **once** across a 28+ minute
observation window (confirmed via `kodi.log`, not inferred), meaning
Kodi's own handling of that very first round of 9,151 `TriggerEpgUpdate()`
calls hadn't finished, and was in fact frozen at the same channel count
(8,131) for over 15 consecutive minutes -- consistent with a Kodi-core-side
threading/performance limitation surfacing under an unusually large
channel count on old hardware, not a hang in this addon's own code (which
never blocks in that loop -- `TriggerEpgUpdate()` is a Kodi SDK call this
addon does not implement).
Reproduced on a genuinely fresh install (`adb shell pm clear
org.xbmc.kodi`, confirmed via `ls .kodi/addons/` showing the addon gone
and a fresh, ~32KB `Epg16.db`), ruling out stale state from repeated
side-load/redeploy cycles during testing as the cause. Real-world impact
looks narrow: live playback, live-timeshift seek, catch-up playback,
real timer/recurring-rule creation, and in-progress-recording
playback/seek all passed on this same device before this was
investigated -- normal use of the addon isn't blocked, only a subset of
channels' guide data (and, by extension, "Record" from a guide entry for
those specific channels) may be incomplete for a while after a very
first cold boot on old/slow hardware with a very large channel count.
Not pursued further -- root-causing past this point would need Kodi-core
thread-dump-level debugging, disproportionate given normal functionality
is unaffected. Revisit if a real user reports this specifically.

## Distribution (Windows/macOS, once built)

Kodi installs binary addons either as a manual zip, or from a self-hosted
repository (a small `repository.xml`-style addon whose own zip contains an
`addons.xml` index pointing at your built zips, served over `https://` or
GitHub Pages). Claude Code can generate that repository structure once the
desktop builds above are working, if you want "install from repository"
rather than "install from zip file."
