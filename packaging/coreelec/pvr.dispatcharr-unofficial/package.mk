# CoreELEC/LibreELEC out-of-tree package definition for this addon.
# CoreELEC's build harness doesn't support pointing at a live git branch the
# way Kodi's own tools/depends/target/binary-addons harness does (see the
# Linux/macOS/Windows steps in ../../../docs/BUILDING.md) -- every in-tree
# package.mk it ships (confirmed against CoreELEC/CoreELEC's own
# pvr.hts/pvr.iptvsimple) points PKG_URL at a tagged release tarball with a
# pinned PKG_SHA256, so this file follows the same pattern. It is NOT picked
# up automatically; copy or symlink it into a CoreELEC source checkout
# before building -- see the "CoreELEC on an ODROID N2+" section of
# ../../../docs/BUILDING.md for the exact steps, including how to fill in
# PKG_SHA256 once a release is tagged.

PKG_VERSION="0.12.0"
# Recomputed against the real release tarball after the tag is pushed and the
# release is published -- see step 2 of the "CoreELEC on an ODROID N2+"
# section of ../../../docs/BUILDING.md, including why hashing this before the
# release exists silently hashes GitHub's 404 page instead.

# pvr.hts (also curl-based, no extra XML/compression libs) uses exactly this
# depends set; nlohmann-json and pugixml are pulled in by this addon's own
# CMakeLists.txt via FetchContent at configure time instead of CoreELEC's
# own textproc/nlohmann-json and textproc/pugixml packages, matching how the
# Linux/macOS/Windows builds already source them -- one dependency-fetch
# path across every target rather than a CoreELEC-specific one.
