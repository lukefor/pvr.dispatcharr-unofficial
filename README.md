# pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial

**This is an unofficial, community-maintained addon.** It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the
[Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) project, nor
by Kodi/Team Kodi -- it's a third-party client built against
Dispatcharr's public API, using Kodi's public addon interface. Please
don't file addon bugs on Dispatcharr's or Kodi's own issue trackers,
and don't expect either project's maintainers to support this addon.

A Kodi PVR (Live TV / DVR) addon for [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr),
built against Dispatcharr's native REST API rather than its Xtream Codes
compatibility layer, so channels, EPG, live TV, and recordings in Kodi map
directly onto Dispatcharr's own backend and settings.

**Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux, CoreELEC (tested on an ODROID N2+),
and Android (arm/arm64, tested on real 32-bit and 64-bit ARM devices).

**Kodi version**: built and tested against Kodi 22 ("Piers"). Kodi
enforces binary-addon compatibility based on what a build actually
compiled against, not something this addon's own `addon.xml` declares a
range for -- a different major Kodi version (older or newer) isn't
guaranteed to load or behave correctly, and hasn't been tested. Kodi 22
raised the PVR instance API from 8.3.0 to 9.2.0 with a matching *minimum*
of 9.2.0, so a Kodi 22 build genuinely cannot load in Kodi 21 and vice
versa -- there is no single binary that covers both. Kodi 21 users should
stay on the [`0.11.0`](https://github.com/BruiserBrody17/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/releases/tag/0.11.0)
release, which is the last one built against Omega.

**Status**: pre-1.0 and actively developed by a single maintainer --
expect occasional rough edges. Verified against Dispatcharr `0.31.0`;
Dispatcharr's own REST API has changed shape across releases before,
so a real incompatibility against a different version is possible and
not guaranteed to be caught yet. Bug reports (with the detail requested
in the issue template) are genuinely useful for exactly this reason.

## Features

- Channel and channel-group listing, with EPG (posters, New/Premiere/Live
  badges, genre, cast, episode names where the EPG source provides them)
- Live TV playback, with optional pause/rewind/seek -- either server-side
  via a companion Dispatcharr plugin, or entirely on-device with no
  Dispatcharr admin account needed (see below)
- Recording playback, including watching a recording while it's still
  being written
- Recording pre/post padding, synced with Dispatcharr's own global
  setting (needs an admin account to change -- see below)
- Commercial-break markers on a recording's seekbar, for recordings
  Dispatcharr's comskip integration has marked (needs the
  `recording_edl` companion plugin)
- One-time, series, and recurring (day-of-week) timers, all editable in
  place from Kodi's own timer list
- Catch-up/archive playback ("play from guide") for channels whose
  provider supports it
- Optional real-time push updates for recordings/timers, so changes made
  elsewhere (another Kodi install, Dispatcharr's web UI) show up
  immediately, not on the next periodic refresh

## Companion Dispatcharr plugins

Two optional server-side plugins live in `dispatcharr-plugin/` in this
repo and install separately on your Dispatcharr instance (not through
Kodi):

- **`timeshift_buffer`** -- enables server-side live TV pause/rewind/seek
  (`live_timeshift_mode` set to `Server-side`): one buffer per channel,
  shared across every device currently watching, torn down as soon as the
  last viewer stops. Requires an admin-level Dispatcharr account (see the
  plugin's own README for the full picture). Without one, use `Local`
  instead: pause/rewind buffered on the Kodi device itself via
  `inputstream.ffmpegdirect`, no admin account or server-side plugin
  needed, but local-only and gone on restart. `Off` (the default) is a
  plain live stream, no pause/rewind, no extra dependency.
- **`recording_edl`** -- exposes comskip commercial-break markers to Kodi.
  Also requires an admin-level Dispatcharr account. Optional; without it
  (or with a non-admin account), recordings just show no markers --
  playback itself is unaffected.

Each has its own README with install steps.

## Installing

1. Download the zip for your platform from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/BruiserBrody17/pvr.dispatcharr-unofficial/releases).
2. In Kodi: **Add-ons -> Install from zip file**, and select the
   downloaded zip.
3. Enable and configure the addon under **Settings -> PVR & Live TV ->
   General -> PVR client add-ons** (or **Add-ons -> My add-ons -> PVR
   clients**, the same list either way): select **Dispatcharr PVR
   Client**, enable it, then **Configure** (see below).

## Configuration

Set in Kodi's addon settings: Dispatcharr host, port, HTTPS toggle,
username, and password. A standard account with `dvr_access` set to
`manage` covers everything native to Dispatcharr -- browsing, playback,
and timer management. An admin account is needed for both companion
plugins and for pushing a recording-padding change back to Dispatcharr
(reading the current value doesn't need one; the write just fails
silently otherwise -- see [docs/RECORDINGS.md](docs/RECORDINGS.md)).

This addon only speaks Dispatcharr's native REST API, not its Xtream
Codes compatibility layer -- there's no separate "XC" username/password
to enter anywhere. A Dispatcharr account with the restricted "Streamer"
role can't log in through this addon at all (Dispatcharr itself rejects
that role's login attempt with "No active account found," regardless of
whether the username/password are correct); use a regular or admin
account instead. Repeated login attempts against wrong or
incompatible credentials can also trigger Dispatcharr's own request
rate-limiting -- if you see "too many requests," wait a few minutes
before retrying with corrected credentials.

Most settings take effect immediately after saving. Connection settings
(host/port/HTTPS/username/password) need a Kodi restart -- Kodi will tell
you when one does.

## Building

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md). This addon builds through
Kodi's own binary-addon build harness, which needs a matching Kodi source
checkout -- it can't be compiled standalone.
`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds Windows/macOS/Linux automatically on
every push and attaches release zips on a version tag.

The `docs/` directory holds engineering notes -- how each feature was
built, root causes for bugs that were found and fixed, and decisions that
were tried and reverted -- kept as project history rather than user
documentation. Start at [docs/API_NOTES.md](docs/API_NOTES.md) if you
want it.
